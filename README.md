# Task Tracker CLI

A simple, fast, and extensible command-line task tracker written in C#.  
This project implements the "Task Tracker" idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) as a cross-platform .NET CLI app. It focuses on being usable from the terminal with a clear UX, persistent storage, filters, tags, projects, and import/export.
